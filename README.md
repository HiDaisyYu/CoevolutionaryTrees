# CoevolutionaryTrees
Coevolution is posited as a major mechanism to create new species, where a challenge is to know how coevolution shaped the related patterns of these species and the traits involved in the interaction. 

Advances in the field of molecular phylogenetics shed light on examining the coevolutionary processes. 

#### Attached R script is used to analyze two phylogenetic trees correlation visually and statistically. 

The input files for the R script: 
Two phylogenetic trees (Newick format) of species coexisted.  

There are small-size test files in this directory (VirusTree.nwk, HostTree.nwk), which can be run locally on your PC to test the R script if you are interested.
